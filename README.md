## DermFridge AI

Proposal: This project presents an AI-powered personal assistant designed to connect nutrition and skincare through intelligent data analysis. By combining facial image recognition with food identification, the system determines the user’s skin type and analyzes the contents of their refrigerator to recommend personalized meals, snacks, and beverages that promote healthier skin. Beyond personalized dietary guidance, the application encourages users to make optimal use of their available ingredients, thus reducing food waste. Driven by the rise of personalized health technologies, the popularity of skincare beauty in South Korea, and the increasing accessibility of computer vision tools, this assistant bridges the gap between skincare and nutrition-focused applications. It supports both personal well-being and environmental sustainability by helping users understand the impact of dietary habits on their skin condition and guiding them toward smarter, skin-friendly food choices. Ultimately, the project aims to empower users to maintain healthy skin naturally while fostering more sustainable and informed eating practices.
